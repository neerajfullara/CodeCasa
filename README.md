Internship Task from the company Code Casa

# Task 1
My first task as an intern at Code Casa. The task was to create a number-guessing game using Java programming language.
The game includes the following features:
1. I generated a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user inputs their guess.
3. I provide feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess was a match, higher, or lower.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
In addition to these features, I added some other elements, such as limiting the number of attempts to 5 or 10, and including multiple rounds. The game currently has two rounds - the primary and a secondary round that the user can choose to continue. At the end of the game, the user's score is displayed and points are awarded based on the number of attempts.
This task was successfully completed using Java.

# Task 2
My Second task as an intern at Code Casa. The task was to create a Digital Library Management System using Java programming language.
Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine generation, advance booking, and report generation
There are essentially two modules of this software:
Admin module: Admin will have complete control over the system. Admin has permission to update, delete, or modify any existing record or make a new entry (books and members).  Users: The normal users enjoy only limited privileges. They have a view access to the books. They can browse through the categories, search for a particular book, and return, and issue books. They are also provided with an email option in case of a query.

# Task 2
My Third task as an intern at Code Casa. The task was to create an Online Reservation System using Java programming language.
Modules
Login Form – To access this Online Reservation System, each user should have a valid login ID and password. After providing the correct login ID and password, users will be able to access the main system. Reservation System – Under the reservation form users will have to fill in the necessary details such as their basic details, train number, train name will automatically come in the box, class type, date of journey, from (place) to destination, and after that, users will have to press insert button. Cancellation Form – If passengers want to cancel their tickets then they have to provide their PNR number and after submitting it, this will display the entire information related to that particular PNR number. If users want to confirm their cancellation, in this case, they have to press the button.
